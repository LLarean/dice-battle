> *A roll of the dice decides your fate.*

**DiceBattle** is an experimental adventure project, created as a personal sandbox for exploring game development. Its core mechanics revolve around a modified dice-rolling system: every hero decision, every encounter, and every plot twist is determined not by chance, but by a unique combination of rolls with non‑standard rules and modifiers.

The player travels through procedurally assembled locations, meets characters, and makes choices—all through the lens of dice that don't quite work the way you'd expect.
